# AR Tour Guide

Currently the primary options for getting a tour of the WWU campus are to either join a guided
tour in-person, or to take a virtual tour. Our project aims to posit a solution that will provide a
new option for users to take a self-guided, or virtually guided tour on campus via their mobile
device.

This will also help with people only wishing to navigate around campus for those unfamiliar with
its layout. Current tours are largely pre-defined and have limited variation, leading to not much
freedom being offered in how the campus is explored. The tour is set in stone, and cannot be
deviated from, shortened, lengthened, or personalized, issues of which our app will aim to fix.
