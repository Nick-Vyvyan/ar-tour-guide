# AR Tour Guide

### Developers: Danny Inga, Ethan Blight, Cole Goodnight, Nick Vyvyan

Currently, the primary options for getting a tour of Western Washington University's main campus are to either join a guided tour in-person, or to take a virtual tour. This project aims to present a solution that will provide a new option for users to navigate around campus, as well as take a self-guided, or virtually guided tour on campus via an Android mobile device utilizing augmented reality (AR).
